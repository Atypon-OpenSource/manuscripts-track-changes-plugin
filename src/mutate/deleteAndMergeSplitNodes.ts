/**
 * Applies deletion to the doc without actually deleting nodes that have not been inserted
 *
 * The hairiest part of this whole library which does a fair bit of magic to split the inserted slice
 * into pieces that can be inserted without deleting nodes in the doc. Basically we first split the
 * inserted slice into merged pieces _if_ the slice was open on either end. Then, we iterate over the deleted
 * range and see if the node in question was completely wrapped in the range (therefore fully deleted)
 * or only partially deleted by the slice. In that case, we merge the content from the inserted slice
 * and keep the original nodes if they do not contain insert attributes.
 *
 * It is definitely a messy function but so far this seems to have been the best approach to prevent
 * deletion of nodes with open slices. Other option would be to allow the deletions to take place but that
 * requires then inserting the deleted nodes back to the doc if their deletion should be prevented, which does
 * not seem trivial either.
 *
 * @param from start of the deleted range
 * @param to end of the deleted range
 * @param gap retained content in a ReplaceAroundStep, not deleted
 * @param startDoc doc before the deletion
 * @param newTr the new track transaction
 * @param schema ProseMirror schema
 * @param deleteAttrs attributes for the dataTracked object
 * @param insertSlice the inserted slice from ReplaceStep
 * @returns mapping adjusted by the applied operations & modified insert slice
