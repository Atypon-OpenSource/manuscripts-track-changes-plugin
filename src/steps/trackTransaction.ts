 * Takes in as arguments the data from appendTransaction to reapply it with the track marks/attributes.
 * We could prevent the initial transaction from being applied all together but since invert works just
 * as well and we can use the intermediate doc for checking which nodes are changed, it's not prevented.

      Remember that every step in a transaction is applied on top of the previous step in that transaction.
      So here, during tracking processing, each step is intended for its own document but not for the final document - the tr.doc
      Because of that when a step is processed it has to be remapped to all the steps that occured after it or it will be mismatched as if there were no steps after it.
      This is apparent only in transactions with multiple insertions/deletions across the document and, withtout such mapping, if the last
      step adds content before (in terms of position in the doc) the first step, the plugin will attempt to insert tracked replacement for the first change at a position
      that corresponds to the first change position if the second change (second in time but occuring earlier in doc) never occured.
