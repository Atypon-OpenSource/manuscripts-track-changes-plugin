       * SEARCH-REPLACE vs HIGHLIGHT-AND-TYPE OPERATION DETECTION
       *
       * This section implements different insert positioning logic for two distinct types of replacement operations:
       *
       * 1. SEARCH-REPLACE OPERATIONS:
       *    - Triggered by: Search-replace UI components (SearchReplace.tsx)
       *    - Metadata: Sets searchReplace' flags
       *    - User Intent: Replace specific text matches found by search functionality
       *    - Expected Behavior: Insert at the END of the deleted text range (toA)
       *      - This maintains the original find-and-replace behavior where replaced text
       *        appears at the end of the deleted range, which is the standard expectation
       *        for search-replace operations in text editors
       *
       * 2. HIGHLIGHT-AND-TYPE OPERATIONS:
       *    - Triggered by: User manually selecting text and typing to replace it
       *    - Method: Normal ProseMirror input handling (keyboard events)
       *    - User Intent: Manually replace selected text by typing over it
       *    - Expected Behavior: Insert at the START of the deleted text range (fromA)
       *      - This ensures the new text appears exactly where the user selected and
       *        started typing, which is the intuitive behavior for manual replacements ( exactly same as google docs)
       *
