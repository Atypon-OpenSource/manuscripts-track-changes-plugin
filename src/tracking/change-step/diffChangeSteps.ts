    // As originally authored splitSliceIntoMergedParts splits open slices into their merged parts
    // leaving out the need to insert the possibly deleted nodes into the doc. However, as matchInserted now
    // traverses the deleted range checking it against the inserted slice this behaves quite in a same way
    // where the opened block nodes are traversed but left unmodified. With an openStart > 0 though the
    // node-attr-updates would additionally have to be filtered out in the processChangeSteps.

    // The old logic is still left as it's as refactoring is painful and would probably break something and just
    // in general, take a lot of time. Therefore, this sliceWasSplit boolean is used to just skip diffing.
