/**
 *
 * This refactoring has to address the followin problems:
 *
 * 1. When implementing/debugging support for a given type of prosemirror step all things that
 *    need to be support are scattered and it's not clear where to look for. There is
 *    - processing of an incoming transaction and creating of a change-step
 *    - diff-ing of a steps to avoid producing duplicated steps (mostly for text changes)
 *    - a function to update dataTracked attributes (updateChangeAttrs) that also handles restoration of them
 *    - a function to apply or revert pending change
 *    - some data interpretation is scattered in body editor and article editor
 *      1) article-editor does some check to understand how to represent changes
 *      2) body-editor is hyper aware of the internal of tc plugin - it does shadow node checks and refChangesChecks
 *    - ability to create complex changes have to be separated and constitute a layer in relation to simple changes
 *      for example when we move a node we first need to create a deletion and an insertion and then post-process it into a single change
 *
 *
 *      Implementation plan:
 *
 *      1. Define contract of Interpreter class
 *      2. Do we actually needs change-steps that we create midway between a change and prosemirror's step?
 *      3. Allow better abstraction in body-editor
